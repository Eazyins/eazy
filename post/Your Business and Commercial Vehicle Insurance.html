                  When you own a business and need to use a truck or car for some type of delivery, shuttle, or other service, you need some type of commercial vehicle insurance. There are various types of policies available, and what type you need depends on what you need it for, and what you need covered.
                  A vehicle that is considered commercial by the law is defined as one that is used for some type of business or commercial purpose. These policies do cost more than personal ones and these do vary by state, depending on what the requirements are where you live. They are intended to protect you, your business, and your employees.

                <p>
                    Vehicles that are usually insured by a commercial vehicle insurance are passenger cars or vans, busses, any agricultural vehicle, and limo's. Other vehicles that can be included are ice cream trucks, box trucks and semi's, catering and food trucks, specialized handicapped vehicles, garbage trucks, and any other type of vehicle. Make sure you know exactly what is covered before you purchase any policy.

                </p>
                <p>Several factors influence the rates for commercial insurance. These factors include the ages and driving records of anyone who drives them, so making sure that they are all good and reliable drivers would be helpful. They may also be affected by the makes and models of the vehicles you are having insured, the number of people each vehicle transports, the type of items that are being transported, and how many miles you plan on putting on each vehicle a year. You must be able to provide as accurate as information as possible so that you can get an accurate estimate, so that your risks can be properly assessed.

                   To find out where to purchase your commercial vehicle insurance, contact your state's insurance department if you do not personally carry any insurance, which is required in most states. If you do have your own personal policy, contact your regular carrier who can help you get what you need. Sometimes you can get discounts for having more than one policy with them.
                </p>

                    The amount you pay each month may determine what kind and how many vehicles your business can operate. You may be able to find low cost quotes on the internet, but these may not give you accurate rates for larger liability situations. Average rates for commercial cars range from $1,200.00 to as much as $2,400.00, between $5,000.00 and $10,000.00 if you plan on operating taxis, and upwards of $35,000.00 if you plan on using busses for your commercial business. Because of the different ranges of prices, it is important for you to know exactly what you need before contacting a commercial vehicle insurance agent.

                <p>
                    No matter what the reason for having a commercial vehicle, insurance is a necessary part of your business. The right policy can make or break the success of your business.
