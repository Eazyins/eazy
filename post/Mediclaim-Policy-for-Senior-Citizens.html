                <p><STRONG>Why is health insurance necessary for senior citizens?</STRONG><br>
                    To explain this, I will discuss with you my real-life incident.
                    </p>
                    <p>“It is a matter of a few months back, my friend's parents fell ill due to some reason, due to which all the savings he had saved were exhausted in the treatment of his parents, after some time the mother-in-law of my same friend Father-in-law also became ill, due to which he lost his savings again, now in this situation he does not understand when all his savings have been exhausted.<br>
                        With this small incident, you must have understood that if you want to keep your savings safe, then why do you need to take health insurance for your parents or any senior citizen.<br>
                        
                        In such a situation, taking health insurance for senior citizens can turn out to be a good deal for you, as you can save a lot of money by paying a small premium every month.
                        
                        Senior citizens struggle to get a good insurance plan, as many types of plans have a lot of capping like pre-adjusting makes it difficult to get a health insurance plan.
                        
                        So in this article, I will tell you about some good health plans, which will help you to get a good health insurance plan (Best health insurance for seniors over 70).
                        

                    </p>
                    <p><h2>Things to consider before buying health insurance
                    </h2></p>
                    <p><b>1- High cover –</b> Whenever you choose a health plan for senior citizens, choose the plan with the highest cover, because after 70 years the chances of your parents getting sick increases. Since, you are choosing a plan with a higher cover, due to this, its premium may also be higher.<br>

                        <b>2- Check ICR (Incurred Claim Ratio) –</b> Before taking a health insurance plan from any company, definitely check its ICR. Do not get confused about this, both ICR and CSR are measured differently, but only check ICR for health insurance.<br>
                        <b>ICR –</b>  means how many policies have been raised by the company in a year and out of which claim cover has been provided. It means how stable the company is. What are the criteria for viewing it?<br>
                        
                        If the company's ICR is above 100%, then it may be possible that the company is losing money, it can mean that the financial stability of the company may be under suspicion.
                        If the ICR is less than 50%, it means that the company is rejecting more claims.
                        The ICR is in the range of 50% to 80%, and if it has been there for many years, then the ICR of the company is good or worth taking.
                        You can also check ICR online on the company's website. If you do not find it on the website, then you can check it in the article below.<br>
                        
                        <b>3- Renew Process –</b> Most of the company provides this facility for a lifetime, but some renew your policy only for 75 or 80 years.<br>
                        
                         
                        <b>4- Additional Service –</b> Senior citizens need to see what other kind of service the company is providing to you. them this check the list given below.<br>
                        Maximum and minimum cover<br>
                        Medical check-up<br>
                        Waiting period<br>
                        Pre and post hospitalization<br>
                        Daycare<br>
                        Organ donor<br>
                        Co-payment<br>
                        <B>5 – Check Premium –</B> This is the most important point, you choose a plan that suits you, which means choose the premium according to your budget.
