                <p><b>If you have insured your vehicle insurance then you must have heard about the No Claim Bonus (NCB). Today in this article you will know what is No Claim Bonus? how does it work? What are its benefits? What is its add-on? And what are its rules? Let us go into detail about the No Claim Bonus (NCB) which is important for you.
                </b></p>
                <h2>What is a No Claim Bonus (NCB)? 
                </h2>
                <p>
                    If an insured takes a policy from the insurance company and does not make any claim during that policy term, then he is rewarded in the form of a No Claim Bonus (NCB). By collecting the No Claim Bonus, the insured can get a discount on the premium amount of his insurance.

                </p>
                <p><h2>NCB full form in insurance: No Claim Bonus | no claim bonus
                </h2></p>
                <p>ncb meaning in insurance: Additional benefit available for not making any claim or claim on an insurance policy

                </p>
                <p><h3>How does the No Claim Bonus work? 
                </h3></p>
                <p>
                    No Claim Bonus helps in reducing the premium of the insured to some extent. Every year, if the insured does not make any claim from the insurance company, then the reward is received in the form of NCB. But if the insured does not use this reward then it keeps on increasing with every claim-free year. let's know

                Suppose you have got your vehicle insured in August 2020. And you drive your vehicle safely. And you do not have any accidents during the term of your policy. After this, when you go to get the insurance renewed in August 2021, you will have to pay less money. This discount in your premium is called a <strong>No Claim Bonus</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Example:<br>

                 Suppose the IDV (Insured Declared Value) of your vehicle is seven lakh rupees. And for getting it insured, do you have to pay a premium of Rs 15000?<br>
                If you do not make any claim after taking the policy, then you will get a 20% discount on next year's premium. That is, now you will have to pay only 12000 rupees instead of 15000 thousand of your premium.
                Now if you do not make any claim for two years after taking the policy, then you will get a 25% discount on the next premium.<br>
                Now if you keep collecting your no claim bonus like this, then your no claim bonus will increase.

                </p>
                <p>Let us know how the No Claim Bonus increases every year according to the rules set by IRDA:

                    <b>Non-Claim Period NCB Exemption (In Percentage)</b><br>
                    20% after one year<br>
                    25% after two years<br>
                    35% after three years<br>
                    45% after four years<br>
                    50% after five years<br>
                    No more than 50 percent discount: No claim bonus increases by 20 to 50 percent if you don't claim it. But NCB does not increase after 50 percent. After this, you can withdraw any number of years without a claim.</p>
                    
                    <p><h3>Benefits of No Claim Bonus (NCB)</h3></p>
                    <p>There are many benefits of a claim bonus in vehicle insurance. Let us know about these benefits in detail:<br>
                    
                    <b>Reward</b>: If you are a smart and good driver and you have kept your vehicle safe. After this, if you do not claim even once during the policy term, then you are given a no claim bonus as a reward.<br>
                    <b>Lower Premium</b>: No Claim Bonus helps in reducing your premium. The No Claim Bonus keeps on increasing every claim-free year. It increases from 20 percent to 50 percent. It can be used at the time of renewal of the insurance policy.<br>
                    <b>Can be transferred to another vehicle or company</b>: If a person has purchased a new vehicle and he can transfer his NCB to the new vehicle. And NCB can be transferred from one insurance company to another.<br>
                    <b>The benefit to the policyholder</b>: In this, the vehicle does not get the benefit but the insured gets the benefit. If an insured sells his old vehicle and buys a new vehicle, then no claim bonus remains with the insured.<br>
                    In which case No Claim Bonus is not available?<br>
                    If you claim NCB in any year then you will not get NCB next year.

                    <p><h3>How to transfer the No Claim Bonus to a new vehicle?
                    </h3></p>
                    <p>Transferring the No Claim Bonus to the new vehicle insured is a simple process. But it is up to the insured as to how he/she wants to get new vehicle insurance: through an agent, online or offline.

                        If a vehicle owner takes his new insurance through an agent or offline, then he has to first approach his old insurance company to get his NCB transferred. After that request him to get his NCB transfer done and all the necessary papers have to be submitted. After doing this process the insurance company will give you the NCB certificate. You will have to submit this certificate to the insurance company from which you are taking your new insurance policy. After this, the company will transfer your NCB.
                        
                        If the insured wants to take his new vehicle insurance online, then to get his NCB transferred, the insured will have to tell the new insurance company the correct NCB, the name of the old insurance company, and his policy number. After that, the new insurance company will contact the old insurance company and transfer your NCB automatically.
                        What is the <strong>No Claim Bonus Protection Cover</strong>? Protection cover is a type of subsidiary insurance policy in NCB. This happens in the form of a rider or insurance add-on. It can be bought with Comprehensive Insurance. If you have taken bonus protection with your vehicle, then you will continue to get the benefit of NCB even after you have claimed the term of your vehicle insurance. These types of add-ons help in keeping your NCB safe. Hence it is known as Claim Bonus Protection Cover. You have to pay 5 to 10 percent more for this type of add-on cover. But it gives a benefit of 20 to 50 percent on your new premium. Conditions of NCB Protection Cover You can claim only one on-damage claim in a year while taking the policy, if you take another claim after that, your NCB protection cover will cease. If the insurance of your vehicle lapses and you do not renew it within 90 days, then your NCB protection cover lapses.
