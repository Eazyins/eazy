Borrowing is one of the most common ways people enter home in the United Kingdom. Every mortgage lender has a set of requirements that borrowers must meet, however, such as a certain amount of income debt. Although UK law does not require you to take out life insurance to take out this type of loan, most homeowners lend it to their needs, and almost all financial experts believe that having a policy to match your mortgage property is wise.

</p>

    <b>
        What Happens in a House After Death?
    </b>
</p>
<p>

To really understand why a mortgage loan is seen as a necessity, you need to understand what will happen to your home after your death, assuming that the loan has not been repaid in full. Under UK law, if your loan is not repaid, a few things can happen. If you have a shared mortgage, then the mortgage loan simply passes to your surviving borrower. If you are the sole owner of the home with a mortgage, the home usually goes to the beneficiary in your will, but your estate must pay off your debts before the beneficiaries can get the property. If there are enough assets in your area to repay the loan without selling the home, then the beneficiary may be able to get the property free and clear, but more often than not, the assets do not completely cover what you owe, therefore. the beneficiary must repay the mortgage on the reservation. The remaining owners and beneficiaries can sell the property, repay the loan from the sale, and pocket any remaining equity balance, too.

</p>
<p>
    <b>
        Lack of Payment Problem
    </b>
</p>
<p>

In the above scenarios, it all assumes that the remaining owners or beneficiaries have a way of paying off what they still owe on their own. However, this is not always the case. For example, a parent may not be able to cover both mortgage and daycare costs. Similarly, many beneficiaries are not financially ready to take out a mortgage payment. If mortgage payments expire long enough, the lender may pay.

</p>
<p>
    <b>
        Enter the Life Insurance Policy
    </b>
</p>
<P>
    If you have life insurance to pay off the rest of your loan, you are removing the possibility that your surviving or benefiting borrower will have difficulty repaying all the loan. They can take out insurance and give the lender what he still owes without having to make a serious financial commitment to keep the property. The fact that they do not have to worry about mortgage payments makes it possible for them to be financially stable, since all the money they would have to put in debt could go beyond other needs or requirements, or at best, be invested. Life insurance, therefore, is accompanied by a home loan, which is a responsible way to eliminate anxiety, allowing surviving borrowers or beneficiaries to maintain a good standard of living and to preserve valuable assets.

Note on Death Benefits in Service

    </b>
</p>
<p>
    Many people mistakenly think that the benefits of Death in Service are a form of life insurance. This is not true at all. Both are the same in that they pay when you die, but the death benefits in the Service are usually more than four times your salary. You can lose them if you lose or change jobs, or if you are disabled. Conversely, you can get insurance with a wide range of values, and they do not depend on your job. This difference means that many lenders see insurance as a very reasonable way for the borrower to reduce the risk, and that they often still require you to have a policy even if your employer offers you death benefits of the Service.

    <b>
        Conclusion

    </b>

</p>
<p>
    Rent housing allows many UK residents to buy a home without having to pay for it in cash. If you die before you can repay the loan, surviving borrowers or beneficiaries may have difficulty compensating for the mortgage payments. Life insurance ensures that they do not experience unnecessary difficulty with maintaining the home, or that the house should be sold.  If you are single and have no dependents, then life insurance becomes less expensive, but you still need to get it based on the principles of your favorite borrower.
