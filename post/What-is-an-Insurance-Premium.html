                    To take advantage of the guarantee of your insurance contract, you have to pay the insurance premium to your insurer. The amount of this premium always depends on the level of coverage you are going to benefit from.

                </p>
                <h1>What is an Insurance Premium? 
                </h1>
                <P>An insurance premium is an amount that an insurer pays to an insurer under an insurance contract made for himself. This is the final amount you pay when your contract with the insurance company matures to be covered against predetermined risks. Therefore, you have to pay the insurance premium to the insurance company at a fixed interval (monthly, quarterly, half-yearly, yearly, etc.).

                    Generally, your insurance premium increases based on the number of coverages you have subscribed for. The more guarantees you have, the higher the risk cover. Insurers also have a "benchmark premium," which they use as an indicator to determine premiums for their members.

                <P><H2>How does insurance premium work? 
                </H2>When we buy insurance from an insurance company, we have to pay some amount in return for that insurance. The insured can choose to pay his insurance premium as per the policy.

                Some insurance companies give the option to their insured to pay the insurance premium in installments. Like monthly, quarterly, half-yearly, yearly, etc. Whereas many other insurance companies offer the option of paying in full in advance before starting any coverage.

                <H2>Types of Insurance Premium
                </H2>
            </P>
            <P>There are mainly three types of insurance premiums according to the terms and conditions of different types of insurance companies. Let us know about these types in detail:

                <br><B>Level premium</B><br>
                As you age. With that, your risk also increases. With that, your insurance premium also goes up. To make things easier for the insured, insurance companies offer the option of paying a level amount for the entire term of the insurance. This means that your premium amount remains fixed and does not change during the term of the policy.
                
               <br> <b>Increasing premium</b><br>
                Those insured who do not want to pay the level premium. They can opt for increasing premiums. That is, your premium keeps increasing during the policy term.
                
                <br><b>Decreasing premium</b><br>
                Those insured who do not want to opt for the level premium or rising premium. Those insured can opt for reduced premiums. This premium is applied to the mortgage redemption policy. In such insurance, the insurance premium is reduced along with the reduction of the remaining loan amount.
                
               <br> <b>On what factors do insurance premiums depend?</b><br>
                Insurance premiums depend on several factors. Due to this, the premium of each policy may be different.
                
                <br>Key Factors Included in Insurance Premium<br>
                
                1.The type of policy chosen by the insured<br>
                2.Age of insured<br>
                3.Habits of the insured like smoking, alcohol, etc.<br>
                4.Medical history of the insured<br>
                5.Income of the insured<br>
                6.Marital status and dependents of the insured<br>
                7.Loan<br></P>
                <p>
               <h3> How is the insurance premium calculated?</h3></p>
               <br> 
               <p>
                In the event of the death of the insured, the death amount, that is, the amount that has to be paid to the insured on the death of the insured is taken care of by the insurance companies. The insurance premium is prepared by estimating the above factors.
                
                The cost of insurance companies like office expenses or rent, a commission of agents, the salary of employees, etc. decides your premium. The interest earned on the premiums invested by you is also taken into account before premium calculation.
                
                The insurance of one person may be different from that of another, as the premium calculation is more than one level process. It depends on many reasons.
