                <p><h3>Types of auto insurance
                </h3></p>
                <p>There are 2 types of vehicle insurance.<br>

                    1.Third-Party Motor Insurance<br>
                    2.Comprehensive Motor Insurance<br>
                    1. <b>What is Third Party Motor Insurance?</b><br>
                    This type of insurance is done not for yourself but a third party. The idea behind this policy is to provide financial compensation in case an accident occurs and another person, his vehicle, or his property is injured. <br>
                    
                    Importance of third party insurance<br>
                    Since it is a statutory obligation for all vehicle owners, all are bound to get insurance.
                    By taking insurance, vehicle owners get peace of mind from any problem caused due to road accidents.<br>
                    Third-party insurance assures the policyholder to save his pocket in case of such misfortune.<br>
                    2. <b>Comprehensive Motor Insurance</b><br>
                    Comprehensive motor insurance is famous as it provides compensation not only to the policyholder but also to third parties for any accidents. Comprehensive motor insurance does not cover the collision of motor vehicles.
                    </p>

                        This is the best protection one can give to their car.
                        It also compensates for the legal compliance of any legal litigation arising out of the accident.
                        It provides peace of mind and financial security not only to the policyholder but also to third parties.
                        
                    </p>
                    <p><h3>Types of Comprehensive Vehicle Insurance
                    </h3></p>
                    <p>There are the following types of comprehensive vehicle insurance:<br>

                       <b>Private Car Insurance Policy</b> :- Government of India has made it mandatory for every vehicle owner to get this insurance. This insurance is taken by an individual for his privately owned car. This insurance covers accidents, theft, natural calamities, and other similar financial losses. This policy also covers any damages caused to third parties.<br>
                        <b>Two-wheeler insurance policy</b>:- This policy is also prescribed to be mandatory by the central government of India. This policy covers damages caused to two-wheelers like bikes or scooters. This policy provides financial assistance for loss due to fire, disaster, theft, or accidents. It pays compensation to both the owner and the passenger in case of an accident.
                        <b>Commercial Vehicle Insurance</b>:- This policy does not cover damages caused to private vehicles. The policy covers damages caused to trucks, buses, heavy commercial vehicles, light commercial vehicles, multi-utility vehicles, agricultural vehicles, etc.<br>
                        <b>Add-on (Comprehensive Motor Insurance)</b>:- Add-on is some of the extra features that the insurance company generally cannot afford without an add-on. Along with add-on insurance, it offers a few more benefits.<br>
                        <b>Zero Depreciation Add On</b>:- If we buy anything, its value keeps on falling with time. Zero depreciation add-on provides a kind of protection so that whenever an accident occurs in a vehicle, it is compensated by adding the depreciated value with whatever value it had at the time of settlement.<br>
                        <b>Engine Protection Cover Add-on</b>:- This add-on compensates for the loss caused by problems like running out of water in the engine or leaking of lubricant oil.
                        Road Side Assistance Add-on:- Assistance is also given at midnight due to the breakdown of several vehicles on the way while going anywhere if the policyholder has purchased this add-on. This add-on is very beneficial for those who travel a lot during the night.<br>
                        <b>Return to Invoice Cover Add-on</b>:- If the policyholder has taken this add-on, then in case of an accident with the vehicle, the insurance company will reimburse the retained value of the vehicle.
