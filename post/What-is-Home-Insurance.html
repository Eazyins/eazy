                <p>There are many benefits of having your own home. And many problems are reduced. Along with this, it is our responsibility to maintain and protect our own house.


                </p>
                <p>
                    To keep our home safe from any natural calamities, it is also necessary for us to have home insurance. Because locking and maintaining the house does not keep the house safe.

                    Home insurance provides coverage against damage to the structure as well as the contents of the house of the policyholder due to an accident. It is a type of property insurance. And it is also known as Homeowner's Insurance.

                </p>
                <p>
                    This insurance covers any natural calamity like flood, fire, earthquake, landslide, storm, etc. in the house of the policyholder. And gives coverage for damages caused by any man-made calamity like riots, theft, terrorist activities, etc.

                </p>
                <p>
                    Whether you have a luxurious house, bungalow, apartment, or flat on rent, you must have home insurance. So that if there is any kind of damage in your house, then you can get financial help.

                </p>
                <p><h3>Why is home insurance necessary? </h3></p>
                <p>
                    Disasters and calamities never come by telling. These are unpredictable accidents. If an accident happens to you in which there is any damage to the property you have accumulated or the house you have built, then you should have home insurance to cover it.

                </p>
                <p>
                    
Home insurance is not necessary but to avoid financial loss to your home, home insurance must be considered.

                </p>
                <p>
                    <h3>Who should buy home insurance? 
                    </h3>
                </p>
                <p>
                    A home insurance policy should be bought by all those who have a house, whether it is owned or rented. Many people believe that home insurance should be bought by those who have their own house. But it is not correct.

                </p>
                <p>
                    Home insurance should also be purchased by a person who lives in a rented house. Because if due to an accident happens in your rental house, then the owner will have to pay that loss to you. But if you have insurance for your rental home, that loss will be covered by the insurance company

                </p>
                <p>
                    Whether you are a tenant or a homeowner buying home insurance should be your priority.
