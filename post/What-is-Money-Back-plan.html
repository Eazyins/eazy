                <p><strong>What is a Money-Back Plan, how does it works, and what are the benefits, and features 
                </strong></p>
                <p>
                    Money Back Policy It is also commonly known as a child money-back plan. This is a life insurance policy. Life insurance is provided in the form of maturity/survival benefits at the end of the policy term. This policy is generally bought for children, in which investment, as well as life insurance benefits, are also available.

                </p>
                 <h1>What is Money Back Plan?
                </h1>
                <p>
                    Money back policy is a type of life insurance product. Which helps the insured to get regular returns. The money-back plan is one of the most popular life insurance plans in India. This type of policy includes both life insurance and investment.

                </p>
                <p>
                    The money-back plan is for those individuals or individuals who wish to get guaranteed returns on their investments. It is different from other life insurance policies. In this, the money-back plan starts paying an amount, which is called survival benefits, over the life of the policy.

                </p>
                <p>
                    Survival benefits are given in the money-back plan after a few years of inception. And this policy continues till maturity. This benefit is given only when the insured is alive. If the insured dies due to any reason, then the survival benefit is not available. In such a situation, the entire maturity amount is paid to the beneficiary of the insured. In such a situation, a money-back plan is a good option to plan for regular income and big expenses in the future

                    How does a money-back plan work?

                    <p>
                        The insured can buy an insurance policy for himself by comparing the money-back plans of different companies. After that, the insured has to pay regular premiums.

A guaranteed sum assured is paid to the beneficiary of the insured in case of the death of the insured after purchasing the insurance policy. Which is known as the death benefit. Apart from this, if the insured survives the policy term, then the maturity amount is paid to him/her.

Apart from this, survival benefits are also paid to the insured at regular intervals throughout the policy term. This plan may also be known as an endowment policy.<br>

Example: Suppose a person buys a money-back plan for 25 years, then the insurance company starts giving him the benefit of survival benefits after 5 years. And this benefit is paid by the insurance company every 5 years. In this situation, the insurance company gives 5th, 10th, 15th, and 20th-year survival benefits to the insured. After that, the remaining survival benefits are given by the insurance policy as maturity benefits. This payment helps the insured to incur large expenses.

                        During the policy, money is paid out to the policyholder every few years. The payout starts within a few years from the inception of the policy and continues till the maturity of the policy term.

                        You are allowed to deduct tax under section 80C of the IT Act. 1,50,000 in life insurance premiums are exempt from your taxable income per annum. In addition, Section 10(10)D waives off the maturity benefit of a money-back policy.

                        On maturity of the money-back plan, the insured receives the maturity benefit. Sum Assured This is the entire cover amount that the insured chooses at the inception of the policy. Bonus This includes the insurer's declared reversionary benefits that have accumulated over time. This is largely determined by the performance of the company.</P><P>

                        Money back policy ensures that the insured will get the return or payment of the promised amount every few years. Thus, the survival benefits value accumulates every few years and provides a second source of income to the policyholders.

                        Money back policy contributes to the income of the insured as a bonus. Each year the bonus is calculated by the insurance provider as a percentage of the sum assured and accumulated. When the policy matures or the policyholder dies, the accumulated bonuses are added to the total payable.

                        Money-back plan means that the money is returned to the insured in the form of survival benefits after a certain period. When the policyholder survives the term of the policy, a refund is guaranteed. In the event of the death of the policyholder, his beneficiary receives the Guaranteed Sum Assured as well as any accumulated bonuses (if any). This also applies to child money-back plans.

                        Most insurance companies offer optional add-on riders that the insured can 'add-on' to his money-back policy, as the name suggests. These riders can be related to medical conditions such as life-threatening illnesses, personal accidents, or term riders.
