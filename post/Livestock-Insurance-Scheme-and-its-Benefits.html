                <p>Animals are an important source of income for livestock farmers and farmers. Animal husbandry and farmers have to suffer a lot due to the death of an animal due to disease, weather, or accident, so the Central Government implemented this <strong>livestock insurance scheme</strong> in 2009-06. It was started in the year 2005-06 of 10th five years. After that, it was run in 2006-07, 2007-08 years also. In these two-five years (10th five-year and 11th five-year plan), this scheme was implemented by selecting 100 districts of the country, which till now is being run regularly in 300 selected districts</p>
                <p><b>The scheme has two objectives</b>- first to provide protection to the farmers and livestock owners from the loss due to the death of animals, and secondly to make the people aware of the benefits of livestock insurance and with the ultimate goal of quality development of livestock and their products. popularize.<br>

                    As per the scheme, indigenous/hybrid milch cattle and buffaloes are insured at the current market price. Up to 50 percent of the premium of insurance is given by the government as a grant. The benefit of this grant is available to a maximum of two animals per beneficiary on a policy for a maximum period of three years. This scheme is being implemented in almost all the states by the respective State Livestock Development Board.
                    </p>
                    <p><h2>Identification method of insured animals</h2>
                    </p>
                    <p>At the time of settlement of the claim for the sum insured of the insured animal, marking is done in the ear of the animal for its correct identification, due to which the identification of the animal is possible. Now the technology of microchips has come so that along with the identification of the animal, its location can also be determined. The cost of affixing the identification mark is borne by the insurance company and the responsibility of its maintenance will rest with the beneficiaries.


                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <h3>Criteria for selection of animals and beneficiaries for the scheme:
                        </h3>
                    </p>
                    <p>Indigenous / hybrid milch cattle and buffaloes are covered under the scheme. In this scheme, in addition to milch cattle/buffalo, such pregnant cattle, which have given birth to a calf at least once, are included.

                        Such cattle or animals which have already been covered in any other animal insurance scheme or scheme, are not included in this scheme.
                        
                        The benefit of a government grant is available to each beneficiary only up to the number of 2 animals and one animal is insured for a maximum period of 3 years.
                        
                        Farmers are encouraged to take a three-year policy, which is affordable and useful in getting insurance benefits even against natural calamities like floods and droughts. But if a farmer wants to take a policy of fewer than three years, then he is given that too.
                        
                        Animal insurance premiums and coverage amounts also vary from state to state.
                        </p>
                        <p><h3>Animal insurance procedure:</h3></p>
                        <p>First of all, the farmer or livestock owner has to give information for insurance in the veterinary hospital of his district to get his animal insured.<br>

                            After that, the veterinary doctor and the insurance agent go to the farmer's or the animal husband's house and check the health of the animal there.
                            A health certificate is issued when the animal is healthy.<br>
                            
                            While insuring the animal, a tag or microchip is placed in the ear of the animal.<br>
                            
                            A photo is taken of the farmer or livestock owner with his animal.<br>
                            
                            Only after this, the insurance policy is issued.<br>
                            
                            <b>Market pricing of animals:</b><br>
                            An animal is insured at its maximum market value. The market value of animals is determined by the authorized veterinarian and insurance agent. Whose parameters are determined by the government such as animal type, the weight of the animal, type of animal, health of the animal, number of cattle, age of the animal, etc
                            In case of a pending claim, the Sum Assured must be paid within 15 days from the date of submission of required documents.
                            
                            Only four documents are required by the insurance companies to settle the claims namely insurance policy, first information report with the insurance company, claim form, and trial report.<br>
                            
                            A clear procedure is followed for the settlement of the claim. After preparing a list of required documents, a copy is also given to the beneficiary.
                            Transfer of ownership on the subject of insurance period:
                            Even if the animal has to be sold to another person during the term of the insurance policy, the insurance policy does not lapse and the benefit of the remaining period of the insurance policy can be transferred to the new owner.
                            </p>
